Instinct
========

The aim is to create a simulation in which Creatures have a bunch of instincts,
which are decided by their DNA. Like our DNA, it's subject to mutations over
time which will change the behaviour of the Creatures.

This is a very simple project in the early stages, which I'm quite enjoying,
and not too fussed about producing anything productive or over scienctific. I'm
just having fun.

State of the world
------------------

At the moment the Creatures can simple clone themselves, with no mutations.
They survive until they die of hunger, as I've not yet implemented food.
